## 📌 Prerequisites

Basic microeconomics and statistics.


## 📌 Course overview

This course explores topics in [behavioural economics](https://news.uchicago.edu/explainer/what-is-behavioral-economics), which seeks to explain how psychological factors influence human decision-making. The aim of the course is to provide you with a solid understanding of (i) why people make the choices they do and (ii) how behavioural insights can be used to inform business strategies and advance policies on health, energy, taxation, and more.    

The course consists of two modules. Module 1 introduces the conceptual foundations of behavioural economics and contrasts them with traditional microeconomic theory. Topics covered in this module include prospect theory, loss aversion, and other choice biases and heuristics. Module 2 covers topics such as people's ability to use new information, social preferences, and nudges. 

A detailed outline of the course is given below. Lectures will combine theory and experimental evidence.


## 📌 Textbook

## 📌 Learning assessment and grading

### Attending students

| **Objective**                                             |   **Assessment method**                       | 
|:----------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|
| Interpret results from research papers                    |   In-class quizzes (x5) <br> Student presentation (x1)  |
| Understand and analyze experimental data                  |   Written assignments (x3)                              |
| Demonstrate knowledge of key theories and policy findings |   Final written exam (x1)                               |

Assignments, presentations, and in-class quizzes will be completed in groups formed at the beginning of the course. Once formed, groups will not be changed.

If you attend classes, then your grade will be determined as follows:
+   In-class quizzes are worth up to a total of 5 points
+   Each group assignment is worth up to 5 points
+   The group presentation is worth up to 3 points
+   The final exam is worth up to 10 points

The final course grade will be scored on a 30-point scale, with 18 being the minimum pass grade. Scores above 30 will be graded as 30 e lode (with distinction).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please pay attention to the following rules:
> 1. If you do not take an in-class quiz, you will receive zero points for that quiz.
> 2. Group assignments must be submitted by the scheduled due date. If you do not hand in an assignment or hand it in late, then you will receive zero points for that assignment. No excuses will be accepted for late submissions.


### Non-attending students

If you do not attend classes, then your assessment will be based on a comprehensive written exam worth 100% of the course grade.


## 📌 Structure of the exams

The final exam for attending students will consist of one open-ended question from either Module 1 or Module 2. 

The comprehensive exam for non-attending students will consist of three open-ended questions from both modules. Two questions will be based on the textbook, while the third question will be based on the other required readings. 

All exams will be closed-book, closed-notes.


## 📌 In-class quizzes

During the course, you will be required to work in groups to complete five in-class quizzes, each approximately 20 minutes in length. The quizzes will be based on one or two research papers to be read before class.

Each quiz will consist of 5 multiple choice or true/false questions. There will be no penalty for wrong answers and each correct answer will be worth 0.2 points (so the maximum possible score is 1 point per quiz). Sometimes you will be asked to briefly justify your answer: answers without justification will be marked as incorrect.

Your total score for in-class quizzes will be the sum of all five scores. Decimals will be rounded to the nearest whole number.


## 📌 Written assignments

As part of your coursework, you will take part in three experiments. Each group will then have to analyze the data set of experimental results and write a short report to answer some questions. The analysis will be performed using [Stata](https://www.stata.com).

The University provides a free Stata licence to all students. You are responsible for ensuring that the software is properly installed on your computer. 

A tutorial will be given in class to help you become familiar with Stata.


## 📌 Student presentations

Each group must choose a research paper to present. Each presentation must be 10 minutes long and should outline (1) the research questions and objectives of the study, (2) the experimental design, and (3) the results.

The list of papers available for presentation is given below. Papers are assigned on a first come, first served basis. To be assigned a paper, go to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nXle0We9WTz8DmncqyGHKRNjiqqXuXZ9uBjFY-FqQ_o/edit?usp=sharing) and write the name of your group next to the paper you would like to present. Papers not selected by a group will not be presented.

Half of the groups will be randomly selected to present during the sixth week of classes, while the other half will present during the twelfth week. The presentation can be given by a single member of the group, by some members or by all of them, depending on what group members decide among themselves. 


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Knowledge of these papers will **not** be assessed in the written exams.
